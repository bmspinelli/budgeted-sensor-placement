# Optimal Detection Sensors
##Placing a limited budget of sensors in trees to optimize source localization.

This repository contains a Python implementation of the algorithms described in [1] together with some testing scripts. 

Also, an extended version of [1] is available in the present repository.  

For any question, suggestion or comment please write to Brunella Spinelli [2].
