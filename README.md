### Budgeted sensor placement for source localization on trees

This repository is a complement to the paper *Budgeted sensor placement for source localization on trees* [1] presented at [LAGOS conference] [3] in May 2015.
It contains a Python implementation of the algorithms described in
[1] together with some testing scripts. 

Also, an extended version of [1] is available in the present repository.  

For any question, suggestion or comment please write to Brunella Spinelli [3].

### Implementation
* sensor_placement/prob_err.py 
    >> algorithm to optimally allocate *k* sensors in order to minimize the
    error probability in source localization, i.e., the probability of
    obtaining an estimated source different from the actual source of the
    diffusion 
* sensor_placement/exp_dist.py 
    >> algorithm to optimally allocate *k* sensors in order to minimize (in expectation) the distance between the estimated source and the actual one
* test_prob_err.py, test_exp_dist.py
    >> scripts to test the above algorithms on randomly generated trees

### Dependencies
This implementation requires Python 2.7 and the following third-party libraries: NetworkX,
functools32.
